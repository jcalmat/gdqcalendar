# Games Done Quick Calendar

GDQ Calendar generates an ICalendar file (ICS) from the current gdq [schedule webpage](https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule)


## How to use it

```
go run cmd/generator/main.go
```

This will generate a `gdq.ics` file which can be imported in your favourite calendar app.
